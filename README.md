## Project Breast Histopathology Images
In this project we present our Convolutional Neural Network for automatic detection and visual analysis of Breast cancer  tissue regions from whole slide images (WSI) of breast cancer. We use a dataset from Breakhis webseite , where the original images, belonging to different patients, have already been preprocessed and divided into small image patches of size 50x50. The patches are classified with either 1 for containing brast or with 0 for not containing breast.

Deep Learning approaches such as the appliance of ConV Neural Networks offer a particularly interesting method for such kinds of problems, especially if a large number of training images is at present.



We divided our project into a couple of  notebooks.
 Based on the old studies , they founf that magnification factors have a crucial role, therofe we devide out notebook into 8 [40X,100X,200X,400X, without data augumentation] 
 and with data augmentation
